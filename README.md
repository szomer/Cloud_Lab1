## Description

The goal of this lab is to set up and deploy an application on Heroku with Node.js. The first and second steps, which is installing all neccesery components and deploying the application, went smoothly. This is partly because all components were already installed previously. (With exception of setting up Heroku) I had some expierence already with Node.js and Express because of previous courses, this resulted into adding a new route easily without any problems. The only issue I faced was adding the project to github because the URL for the repository was not set properly. After a short google session I was able to set the correct URL and push the project to this newly created repository.
